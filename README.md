## TL;DR
_Make sure Python 3.6+ is setup_
> git clone https://github.com/ericksonwinter/AdventOfCode2021.git<br>
> python app.py -d <Day> -p <Part> -v

## Happy Merry!
Each day is setup in it's own file: Day<X>.py, where X represents the day of the Advent.  If run on it's own, __main__ is run, otherwise you can call from the app.py selector that will include the Advent scripts as needed.<br>
