## TL;DR
_Make sure Python 3.6+ is setup_
> git clone https://github.com/ericksonwinter/AdventOfCode2021.git<br>
> python app.py -d D -p P -v

### Parameters
d - D represenst the Day of Advent
p - P the Part
v - be verbose

## Happy Merry!
Each day is setup in it's own file: DayX.py, where X represents the day of the Advent.  If run on it's own, __main__ is run, otherwise you can call from the app.py selector that will include the Advent scripts as needed.<br>

Starting with just refreshing on some basic Python and likely moving in to Pandas and Dataframes here at some point, so:
- Pandas
- Dask to play with paralell processing
- FastAPI to interact with an API
